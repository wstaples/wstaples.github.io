## 05/24

Mom brought a few plants for my birthday.

- Tomatoes - Early Girl, Brandywine heirloom and a cherry type
- 3 California bell pepper plants
- Swiss chard (2 different colors or was one collard greens?)
- 6 basil plants
- 2 strawberries

I'm going to plant them using self watering containers and Mels mix.

## ??/??

When did I plant the first crop? The Home Depot order did not arrive until June 2nd. Maybe that Saturday?

Mels mix was:

- 2 bags of mushroom compost from lowes
- 2 bags of very good compost from homedepot
- 2 bags of black kow from homedepot
- 4 bags of 1cu vermiculate from home depot
- 1 3.8cu bag of peat moss from Paris farmers union (green / white bag)

## 06/21

I bought some plants from Paris farmers on sale. The snap peas are in bad shape but I really wanted them.

- Acorn squash
- Red cabbage
- Snap peas

While I was there I also bought a large grow bag for the potatoes art gave me in April/May? Which he bought at some local green house.

## 06/23

While I was watering the garden I saw what I believe to be a wild strawberry. I planted it with the other strawberries.

## 06/25

I bought more buckets and soil at Home Depot. This time instead of vermiculite/peat I bought ProMix in a yellow and black bag that has perlite and vermiculite. It smells funny I think because of the wetting agent. New mix #2 - promix

- 1 promix compressed 1cu block
- 1 bag black kow
- 1 bag very good compost

Planted from seed:

- 2 buckets of ferry-morse G90 Hybrid Sweet corn
  - 10 days to germinate, July 5th
  - 90 days to harvest, Sept 23rd
- 2 buckets of ferry-morse tender sweet carrots
  - 14-25 days to germinate, July 9th-July 20th
  - 75 days to harvest, Sept 8th

Started hydroponics with 2 squash from Paris farmers, a spearmint plant I bought at hannafords, and 3 basil. The basil plants have been sitting in the box since my mother brought them on my birthday. The bugs have definitely gotten to them. The blue meeter amazingly worked after not being used for 7+ years. I didn't even have to change the batteries. But I did. The salt tested at CF 20. I no longer have the wicks for the system so I simply left them out.

## 06/26

I finished planting the potato's in the large grow bag and I think that's it everything has been planted. I now have a total of 20 buckets, A large grow bag,  and 6 spots in the hydro system. I put 2 batches of the "new mix #2" in the large grow bag and it still needs more. I will wait until the potatoes begin to grow. I planted 2 red cabbage plants in the center of the potato bed. I didn't want to throw them away but if the get in the way of the potatoes I will just pull them. I have 3 cabbages in self watering containers and 1 in the hydro.

I also constructed a trellis from T-posts and a cattle panel I bought at tractor supply. In total it was about $70 but next time it will be cheaper since I won't have to buy wire or plastic tops. It looks really nice and was very easy to setup. I used the 16' x 50 inch panel. I have placed the peas on the outside closed to Pat/Susans house which I believe is NE. I placed the squash on the other side (west?). I bet once the squash grows up the sides the kids will have fun playing under it.

## 06/29

After 3 days of intense sun 90+ degrees, Everything in the hydro system is really starting to suffer. It's all very wilted. The basil which was already bothered by bugs is looking very sad. I bought a spray bottle and will periodically wet everything to keep it cool.

I have been watering the potatoes and containers everyday. I believe the snap peas are lost. Not only were they in terrible shape when I bought them, they spent several days on the ground in an open paper bag while I bought / build more containers to house them. Everything else in the garden seems to be doing fine.

I haven't seen any bugs yet but something is definitely eating the basil and chard. I don't think I need to do anything yet because it doesn't seem to be a big problem just some small holes. 

## 07/07

Changed the hydro nutrients. New one are testing at 1.2. There was mosquito larva in it. I changed the air stone to the smaller blue one to see if it would make more turbulence. I think that would help the mosquito issue. I will also get some craft felt at Walmart to replace the wicking strips that I lost.

## 07/10

After several days of rain / cloudy weather, yesterday was very hard rain with a flood watch, I have changed the hydro fluid again. Before changing it tested with a PH of 8 and .4 EC. No mosquitoes this time. I did not change the fluid I just removed the excess water (it was very full) and added some about 1.5 tsp nutrients and 1.5 tsp vinegar. Now it tests at 1.6EC and 6.6 PH. I also installed the wicks. I used white craft felt I bought at Walmart for 28 cents. I did not put a wick in the spearmint as it has a large root system the size of a softball and seems to be thriving. I'm doing an experiment with the wicks and squash. The squash all the way to the left that has 2 plants in it seems to be the best of the 2. I put a wick in the center squash that is slightly smaller. The theory being that if the wicks actually do anything the single squash that was a little smaller should start growing faster. 

The tomato plants seem to be doing something worthy of investigation. The leaves are curling like a taco. googling says that its stress probably all of the wind and hard rain we have had. There was also the extreme heat last week. (6/29)

## 07/13

Deer! The deer have gotten into my garden and eaten the swiss chard completely. as well as the very tops to the strawberries. They have completely eaten both cabbage plants located in my potato garden as well as one in the bucket.  I still have one remaining cabbage plant in the garden as well as one in the hydro. 

## 07/14

Even after a few days of cloudy damp weather the buckets were empty and needed water. I moved the new snap peas to the front of the bucket. They are doing great. already bigger than the one remaining from Paris farmers which is barley hanging on. I should plant a fast crop in the buckets that have now become available due to the dear. 2 in all. 

## 07/15

I have finally filled the potato planter. I used the 2 buckets the deer made available. The Swiss chard had an amazing root system that reached into the water resivior. The net pot was root bound and kept its shape after being removed. No mold or misquotes. 

I had to make another batch of the promix style with compost and a mix of 1 bucket peat moss + 1 bucket vermiculate (no compost). I now have 2 empty buckets that need soil and can be planted. https://www.ufseeds.com/what-to-plant-in-july.html

Beans (pole)

Brussel Sprouts

Cucumbers





## 07/16

2 of the tomato plants have bottom leaves that are starting to turn yellow. The plants are the large variety not the cherry. 

## 2021 Conclusion

I under estimated the amount of soil it would take to fill all the buckets. especially the potato garden.

I under estimated the amount of money this would take

It seems that nursing sick seedlings/young plants would actually take longer that just planting new ones sometimes. My snap peas for example. I planted 3 seeds after I knew the paris farmers peas were not going to make it. The basil in the hydro is really struggling and I think it would have been faster to just plant a bunch of new ones like self sufficient me does.
