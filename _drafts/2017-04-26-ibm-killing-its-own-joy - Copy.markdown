I recently returned from the [http://www.neugc.org/](IBM i NEUGC) (an IBM user group). As is the point of a conference I was very excited
and couldn't wait to get back to work and try out all of the new things I have learned. All it took was one visit to IBM's Entitled software download to remember IBM is a dying company. They are so old fashioned in they way the manage everything.
